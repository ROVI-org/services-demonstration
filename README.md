# ROVI Services Demonstration

> This project does not yet use ROVI's DataHub or Digital Twin platforms.
> The data and compute backends are instead provided by barebones, proof-of-concept code.

A demonstration pipeline that starts with uploading data and ends with a system health dashboard.

Learn how to use the service via the documentation [./docs/](./docs/)

## Installation

Build the environment using Anaconda

`conda env create --file environment.yml`

## Acknowledgements

The motivation and funding for this project came from the Rapid Operational Validation Initiative (ROVI) sponsored by the Office of Electricity. The focus of ROVI is "to greatly reduce time required for emerging energy storage technologies to go from lab to market by developing new tools that will accelerate the testing and validation process needed to ensure commercial success."
